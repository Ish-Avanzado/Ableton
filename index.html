            Making music isn't easy. It takes time, effort, and learning. But
            when you're in the flow, it's incredibly rewarding.
          </h4>
          <p>
            We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving
            force behind Ableton is our passion for what we make, and the people

          <h4>
            We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries divided
            between our headquarters in Berlin and our offices in Los Angeles
            and Tokyo.
          </h4>
          <p>
            Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us
            use Live and Push every day. We come from a wide range of cultural
            and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are
            self-taught, and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects
            us is the shared belief that each of us has the skills and knowledge
            to contribute to something big: helping to shape the future of music
            culture.

            Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our
            people what they need to work their magic and grow. We've learned
            that achieving the best results comes from building teams that are
            richly diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider set
            of perspectives. We don't always agree with each other, but opinion
            and debate are valued and openly encouraged.

            We work hard to foster an environment where people can grow both
            personally and professionally, and we strive to create a wealth of
            opportunities to learn from and with each other. Alongside an
            internal training program, employees are actively supported in
            acquiring new knowledge and skills, and coached on applying these in
            their daily work. In addition, staff organized development and music
            salons are a chance to discuss new technologies, production
            techniques and best practices.
